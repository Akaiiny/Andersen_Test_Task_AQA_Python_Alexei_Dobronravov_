Task 
  1) Make up an algorithm 
If the entered number is greater than 7, then print “Hello” 
If the entered name matches “John”, then output “Hello, John”, if not, then output "There is no such name" 
There is a numeric array at the input, it is necessary to output array elements that are multiples of 3 
 
  2) Answer the questions 
Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]] 
Can this sequence be considered correct? 
If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct? 
 
Bonus points: 
+ the ability to run the received program 
++ interactive input of values for processing and output of processed data 
(for example, via the console) 

Answer for the second question
This sequence isn't correct because there is only one openning square braket '[' and to closing square brackets ']]' 
So we need to remove the last closing square bracket form the sequence
